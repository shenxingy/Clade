# Radar — find what we didn't know to look for

`/research` answers a question you can already phrase. Radar exists for the
other failure: **you cannot search for a word you have never heard.**

The motivating miss is concrete. "Graph engineering" — the successor framing to
loop engineering — reached this stack because a human mentioned it, not because
anything here noticed. Every scheduled-research design that starts from a topic
list would have missed it identically, because the list would have contained
"agents", "RAG", "context engineering", and not the term that had yet to exist.

So the unit of work is not *a topic*. It is **the delta between what the field
is saying and what this stack's ledger says it knows.**

## The ledger is the mechanism

`~/.claude/research/known-concepts.md` records every concept this stack has
already encountered — one per line, lowercase, with the date first seen.

It lives in `~/.claude/`, not a project: the field does not change per
repository, and a per-repo ledger would relearn the same terms N times.

Novelty is defined mechanically: **a term not in the ledger is a candidate.**
That is the entire trick, and it is why the ledger must be seeded honestly and
appended to on every run. A ledger that is not updated re-reports the same
findings forever; a ledger that is padded with terms nobody actually understood
suppresses real discoveries.

## Procedure

Three lanes feed the sweep. Running only the first is the common failure — the
web tells you what the field says, never what *you* keep tripping over.

| Lane | Source | Already exists? |
|---|---|---|
| A. The field | Broad web probes (§1) | No — this skill adds it |
| B. Named practitioners | `docs/who-to-learn-from.md` | Yes, but manual + quarterly |
| C. Your own usage | `~/.claude/corrections/history.jsonl` | Yes, but unmined |

**Lane B** — do not rebuild the roster. Read `docs/who-to-learn-from.md`, take
the Tier-1 entries whose canonical piece has changed since `Last reviewed`, and
run them through the same triage. Append genuinely new names *to that file*,
not to the ledger; the ledger is for concepts, that file is for people.

**Lane C — the one nobody runs.** The correction history is a record of where
this stack actually failed *you*, which no amount of web sweeping can supply.
It is mined for a different question than the rule-promoter asks: not "should
this one become a rule" but **"what do I get corrected about repeatedly, and
what does that pattern say is structurally missing?"**

Read it as a JSON stream (`jq -c '.'`), and cluster on:

- Recurring `project` + `type` pairs, and recurring language in `prompt` — three
  corrections of the same class is a design signal, not three mistakes.
- Entries carrying `reverted_files` — a rejected diff is the strongest evidence
  available; the words may be vague, the diff never is. Read the caveat below
  before trusting this field.
- `repeat: true` — flagged recurrence, already computed.

**Know the schema before you grep it.** `history.jsonl` records are
`{timestamp, prompt, project, type}`, plus `reverted_files` and `repeat` on
some. There is no `domain` and no `root_cause` — this spec asked for both until
2026-08-31, which sent three runs looking for fields that were never written.
`domain` lives in the *other* file, `cross-project-rules.jsonl`.

**Two serialization styles, one file.** Records written up to 2026-08-14 are
spaced (`{"timestamp": "..."`), records from 2026-08-15 on are compact
(`{"timestamp":"..."`). At the 2026-08-31 sweep that was 853 spaced and 110
compact out of 963. Any pattern keyed to one style silently drops the other —
grepping `'"prompt":"'` returns 110 and reads like the whole file. Parse with
`jq`, which handles both; never line-grep this file for a count. The same trap
is live in `configs/scripts/session-scorecard.sh`, whose awk matches only the
compact form (it windows on recent records, so it is latent, not currently wrong).

**`reverted_files` is not a revert set.** `revert-detector.sh:57` fills it from
`cp_recent_files(session_key, 20)` — the last 20 distinct files Claude touched
*in that session* — and never intersects them with what the git command actually
names. So `git checkout -- one_file.py` is recorded as reverting up to twenty
unrelated files, including scratch paths and files from other projects. `repeat`
is then computed by intersecting those same session lists
(`revert-detector.sh:66`), so it largely measures *session length and overlap*,
not that the same mistake recurred. Treat both as weak hints, and confirm any
cluster against the actual diff before calling it evidence.

A cluster that keeps recurring despite an existing rule means the rule is the
wrong instrument. Escalate it to something structural — a hook, a CI gate, a
test — rather than rewording the prose. The `/generate-hook` skill exists for
exactly that conversion, and `configs/hooks/lib/rule-effectiveness.sh` already
tracks which rules keep getting missed.

### 1. Sweep broadly — probes, not topics

Run searches whose shape invites unfamiliar vocabulary. Rotate them; do not
narrow to what you already track:

- Succession framings: `"X is the new Y" AI agents`, `beyond <current paradigm>`,
  `successor to <known term>`, `what replaced <known term>`
- Vocabulary shifts: `new term AI engineering <current month year>`,
  `stopped calling it <known term>`
- Practitioner surfaces: Hacker News discussion trends, arXiv recent-and-cited,
  named practitioner blogs, framework changelogs and their *rationale* sections
- Negative space: `why <known approach> doesn't work`, `limitations of <known term>`

Bias toward the last 90 days. Prefer sources that argue rather than announce —
a post explaining why a paradigm broke names its successor.

### 2. Extract candidate terms

Pull every named concept, method, architecture, or piece of vocabulary. Keep
the term, a one-line definition **in the source's words**, and the URL.

Do not filter for relevance yet. Filtering before diffing is how a genuinely
novel idea gets discarded for looking irrelevant.

### 3. Diff against the ledger

Drop anything already listed. What remains is the discovery set.

If the discovery set is empty, say so plainly and stop. A quiet week is a real
result; manufacturing a finding to justify the run is worse than silence.

### 4. Triage each survivor against this stack

For each new concept, answer three questions, in this order:

1. **What is it, in one sentence?** Source's claim, not your paraphrase of the hype.
2. **Do we already have it under another name?** Compare *mechanism*, not
   vocabulary. `/loop` ≈ Ralph; a declared state graph ≠ an agent graph. Most
   "gaps" die here, and that is the point.
3. **If we genuinely lack it — is it a deficiency or a difference?** Name the
   concrete thing it would let us do that we cannot do today. If you cannot
   name one, it is a difference. Say so and move on.

Never mark something as a gap on step 1 alone. That rule exists in `CLAUDE.md`
for exactly this workflow.

### 5. Report, bounded

At most 5 findings, ranked by "would this have changed a decision we made".
Each gets: term, one-line definition, our status (`have it` / `different` /
`genuine gap`), and one line of evidence for that status — a file path, a
module, a command. Assertions without a locator are not findings.

### 6. Append to the ledger

Add every candidate examined — including the ones judged irrelevant. The ledger
records *encountered*, not *adopted*; otherwise the same dead end resurfaces
every run.

Format: `- YYYY-MM-DD  <term>  — <one-line definition>`

## Scheduling

Radar is worth running unattended. Weekly is the natural cadence — fast enough
that a shift is caught within a cycle, slow enough that the discovery set is
not noise.

Wire it with the `schedule` skill (cloud cron) or a local `crontab` entry
invoking Claude Code headless. Whatever runs it must be able to write
`~/.claude/research/`.

## 7. Close the loop — a digest nobody acts on is theatre

Discovery is only the first third. The pattern that actually moved this stack
was *found gap → built it → verified → committed*, inside one session. A weekly
file accumulating in `~/.claude/research/` while nothing changes is worse than
not running: it produces the feeling of keeping up without the fact of it.

So every finding graded **genuine gap** must leave a durable, actionable trace
before the run ends:

- **Small and unambiguous** (a missing check, a one-file addition): build it now,
  with a test, and say so. Do not file a TODO for work that takes ten minutes —
  identified is not the same as executed.
- **Large or a real architectural fork**: append one line to the project's
  `TODO.md` (or `BRAINSTORM.md` if the shape is still open), naming the gap, the
  concrete capability we lack, and the evidence locator. Then say plainly that
  it is queued and why it was not built now.

Findings graded `have it` or `different` need no trace beyond the ledger. Say
which of ours already covers it, with a locator — that sentence is what stops
the same idea being re-litigated next quarter.

## Output

Write the digest to `~/.claude/research/radar-YYYY-MM-DD.md` and print the
ranked findings. If run interactively, print only — the human decides whether
it is worth a file.

Close with one line that is honest about coverage: which probe families ran,
how many candidates were examined, and what was NOT swept. A radar that hides
its blind spots reads as completeness it does not have.
