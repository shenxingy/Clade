# Delivery

Clade's provider-neutral Git delivery control plane. It adapts to the target
repository, forge, event, branch ownership, worktree, and runtime before
changing state. It preserves useful work promptly without treating a commit as
permission to push, open a PR, merge, or delete a branch.

## Invariants

- Probe before acting; `unknown` never means allowed.
- One session owns one mutable branch/worktree.
- A coherent slice ends in a commit, detached reachable ref/snapshot, patch, or
  explicit blocker—not an undocumented dirty tree.
- Checkpoint verification is focused; candidate verification is complete and
  bound to the exact head SHA.
- PR creation is idempotent, merge is an explicit integrator action, and
  cleanup is verified.
- Repository policy and explicit user authority outrank Clade defaults.
- Authority granted after START is recorded through the audited `authorize`
  transition; never edit delivery state directly.

The executable workflow and state schema live in `prompt.md` and
`scripts/delivery.py`. Runtime-specific mechanics live under `surfaces/`.
