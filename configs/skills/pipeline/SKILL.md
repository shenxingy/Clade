# Pipeline Skill

Checks the health of all registered background pipelines and displays a status dashboard.

## What it does

1. Reads `~/.claude/pipeline-registry.yml` for registered project paths
2. For each project, reads `PROJECT/.claude/pipeline.yml` for pipeline definitions
3. Runs health checks (systemd, port, process, logfile)
4. Displays a clean dashboard with HEALTHY / DEGRADED / DEAD indicators

## Usage

```
/pipeline                    # Check all registered projects
/pipeline deepfake            # Filter to projects matching "deepfake"
/pipeline watch               # Instructions for continuous watch mode
```
