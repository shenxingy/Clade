# Worktree

Create or manage isolated agent workspaces without assuming every runtime uses
a sibling directory plus immediate branch. Worktree ownership is recorded in
the shared `$delivery` state; independently reviewable work integrates through
the target repository's PR/queue policy, not an arbitrary local merge.
