# FLOW Framework — Find · Leverage · Optimize · Win

> Framework and prompts © Daniel Agrici, CC BY 4.0 — github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow

FLOW is an evidence-led SEO operating model built for the AI-search era. Claude SEO
integrates the FLOW prompt library (41 prompts across 5 stages) so every analysis can
be driven by structured, evidence-backed AI prompts rather than improvised queries.

**Runtime context:** Load `references/flow-framework.md` on every `/seo flow` activation.
Load prompt files on demand — only for the stage the user requests.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/seo flow` | Show FLOW overview + stage menu |
| `/seo flow find [url\|topic]` | Find-stage: keyword research, gap analysis, SERP intent mapping (5 prompts) |
| `/seo flow leverage [url]` | Leverage-stage: backlink strategy, off-site authority (1 prompt) |
| `/seo flow optimize [url]` | Optimize-stage: select 2-3 most relevant of 21 prompts based on context |
| `/seo flow win [url]` | Win-stage: BOFU, conversion rate, dual-surface scorecard (3 prompts) |
| `/seo flow local [url]` | Local-stage: GBP optimization, meta, title tags, local audits (11 prompts) |
| `/seo flow prompts` | Full index of all 41 prompts — stage, name, trigger conditions |
| `/seo flow sync` | Report vendor state and verify the lockfile — automatic sync is not implemented |

## Orchestration Logic

### On `/seo flow` (no sub-command)
1. Read `references/flow-framework.md`
2. Show the FLOW stage overview with a one-line description of each stage
3. Ask: which stage matches the user's current situation?

### On `/seo flow find [url|topic]`
1. Read all files in `references/prompts/find/`
2. Apply each prompt to the URL or topic
3. Cross-reference: "For deeper SERP clustering, see `/seo cluster <seed-keyword>`"

### On `/seo flow leverage [url]`
1. Read the file in `references/prompts/leverage/`
2. Apply to the URL's current backlink context
3. Cross-reference: "For raw backlink data, see `/seo backlinks <url>`"

### On `/seo flow optimize [url]`
1. Read all file names in `references/prompts/optimize/`
2. Read prior analysis context (URL, industry vertical, any prior skill output in conversation)
3. Select 2-3 most relevant prompts; load only those files
4. Apply selected prompts; note the others are accessible via `/seo flow prompts`
5. Cross-reference: "For full content quality analysis, see `/seo content <url>` and `/seo geo <url>`"

### On `/seo flow win [url]`
1. Read all files in `references/prompts/win/`
2. Apply each prompt to the URL's conversion and BOFU context
3. Cross-reference: "For SXO persona scoring, see `/seo sxo <url>`"

### On `/seo flow local [url]`
1. Read all files in `references/prompts/local/`
2. Apply to the URL's local SEO context
3. Cross-reference: "For full local SEO analysis, see `/seo local <url>` and `/seo maps [command]`"

### On `/seo flow prompts`
1. Read `references/prompts/README.md`
2. Display the full index: all 41 prompts with stage, name, trigger conditions

### On `/seo flow sync`
1. Tell the user automatic sync is **not implemented** — no sync script ships
   with Clade. Do not improvise one; that would pull third-party content into
   their tree unreviewed.
2. The prompts under `references/prompts/` are vendored at the state pinned by
   `references/flow-prompts.lock`. Verify and show the result:
   From the skills root (`~/.claude/` in an install, `configs/` in the repo): `sha256sum -c --quiet skills/seo-flow/references/flow-prompts.lock` — the manifest's paths are rooted there, not at `references/`.
3. To update, point at github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow to review and re-vendor
   deliberately.
4. Show attribution notice.

## Context Matching (Optimize stage)

The optimize stage has 21 prompts. Dumping all 21 is noise. Select by priority:

1. **Industry vertical** (SaaS → on-page + technical; local → citations + GBP; publisher → E-E-A-T + freshness)
2. **Prior skill output** (seo-technical flagged crawl issues → technical optimize prompts; seo-content flagged E-E-A-T gaps → content optimize prompts)
3. **URL signals** (product pages → conversion; blog → freshness + authority)

Always surface exactly 2-3 prompts. State which prompts you chose and why.

## Reference Files

Load on-demand — do NOT load all at startup:
- `references/flow-framework.md` — FLOW operating model (load on every `/seo flow` activation)
- `references/bibliography.md` — Evidence sources; load when citing studies or statistics
- `references/prompts/README.md` — Prompt index; load for `/seo flow prompts`
- `references/prompts/find/` — 5 prompts; load for `/seo flow find`
- `references/prompts/leverage/` — 1 prompt; load for `/seo flow leverage`
- `references/prompts/optimize/` — 21 prompts; load selectively for `/seo flow optimize`
- `references/prompts/win/` — 3 prompts; load for `/seo flow win`
- `references/prompts/local/` — 11 prompts; load for `/seo flow local`

---

## Attribution

Every `/seo flow` activation (any sub-command) outputs before analysis:

```
Framework and prompts © Daniel Agrici, CC BY 4.0 — github.com/AgriciDaniel/flow
```

Do not omit or modify the attribution.

## Error Handling

| Scenario | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `references/flow-framework.md` missing | The vendored reference is gone from the install. Reinstall Clade (`./install.sh`); do not point at a sync that does not exist. |
| Prompt file missing | Same: the vendored copy is incomplete. Reinstall, then re-check `sha256sum -c --quiet skills/seo-flow/references/flow-prompts.lock` from the skills root. |
| `sha256sum -c` reports a mismatch | A vendored prompt was edited locally. Name the files listed; do not overwrite without asking — the edit may be intentional. |
| User asks to auto-sync from upstream | Not implemented. The prompts are vendored and pinned by the lockfile; offer to show the upstream diff instead of fetching. |
