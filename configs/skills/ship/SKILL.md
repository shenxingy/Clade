# /ship — Full Release Pipeline

Full release pipeline: tests → coverage → review gate → version bump → CHANGELOG → commit → PR.
Each step is a hard gate — failure stops the pipeline and reports clearly.

## After shipping

Run `/document-release` to sync README, CHANGELOG, and docs with the new release.
For web projects: run `/seo audit <url>` to verify no SEO regression from the release.
If running paid ads: run `/ads audit` to verify tracking pixels and conversion events still fire correctly after the release.
