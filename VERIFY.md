## Known Limitations (⚠)

| ID | Checkpoint | Status | Notes |
|----|-----------|--------|-------|
| KL1 | Guardian false-positive when blocked pattern appears inline with a command (not a pure assignment) | ⚠ | Fixed 2026-03-30: SCANNABLE strips `VAR='...'` and `VAR="..."` lines. Residual edge case: `ENV_VAR="..." migration-cmd` on one line not stripped (rare). Use base64-decode trick for guardian tests. |
| KL2 | `/commit`, `/loop`, `/start` skills cannot be fully E2E tested without actual uncommitted changes or a running background loop | ⚠ | Skill prompt content verified; runtime behavior requires manual spot-check |
| KL3 | Orchestrator API endpoint behavior untested (no running server in this review session) | ⚠ | Python syntax + tests pass. API routes require `uvicorn server:app` running |
| KL4 | Windows not supported — scripts use bash, `~/.claude/` paths, and POSIX tools | ⚠ | WSL2 would work; native Windows CMD/PowerShell is out of scope |

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
<!-- Scripts must work on both Linux and macOS. -->

| ID | Checkpoint | Status | Verified | Notes |
|----|-----------|--------|----------|-------|
| XP1 | `sha256sum` calls have macOS fallback (`shasum -a 256`) in `install.sh`, `session-context.sh`, `start.sh` | ✅ | 2026-03-30 | `_SHA256` bash array pattern used; `xargs "${_SHA256[@]}"` works on both |
| XP2 | `timeout` calls in `loop-runner.sh` use `_timeout()` cross-platform wrapper (gtimeout → timeout → no-op) | ✅ | 2026-03-30 | matches wrapper already in run-tasks.sh and run-tasks-parallel.sh |
| XP3 | `sed -i` uses `_sed_i()` wrapper in `tmux-dispatch.sh` | ✅ | 2026-03-30 | macOS requires `sed -i ''` |
| XP4 | `readlink -f` uses python3 fallback in `scan-todos.sh` | ✅ | 2026-03-30 | macOS lacks GNU readlink -f |
| XP5 | `stat -c` calls have `stat -f` macOS fallback in session-context.sh and run-tasks*.sh | ✅ | 2026-03-30 | all instances use `|| stat -f` pattern |
